Dear Statiq Team,

I'm reaching out from EVCharge India (evcharge.in), a platform helping EV 
drivers discover and compare charging stations across India.

We currently serve 600+ stations and are seeing growing interest from EV owners 
looking for reliable charging infrastructure. Statiq's network of 7,000+ stations

4. Help users find Statiq stations along their routes

What we need:
- Station locations and details (via API or data export)
- Real-time availability status (if technically feasible)
- Current pricing information
- Station amenities and connector types

What you get:
- Increased visibility among EV owners
- More traffic to your charging network
- Better user experience = more satisfied customers
- Free marketing and promotion

We're excited to showcase India's largest EV charging network and would love 
to discuss how this partnership can benefit Statiq.

Could we schedule a brief call to explore this opportunity?
