## 📧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION: Send These Emails**

### Email 1: Statiq (Highest Priority - 7,000+ stations)

**To:** partnerships@statiq.in  
**CC:** info@statiq.in  
**Subject:** API Partnership Request - EVCharge India Platform

```
Dear Statiq Team,

I'm building EVCharge India (evcharge.in), a platform helping EV drivers discover 
charging stations across India.

I discovered that Statiq has a robust API infrastructure (api.statiq.in) that 
powers your mobile app. I would love to integrate this same API to showcase 
Statiq's 7,000+ stations on our platform.

Benefits for Statiq:
✓ Drive more users to Statiq charging points
✓ Increase brand visibility among EV owners
✓ Better station discovery = higher utilization
✓ Free marketing and promotion
✓ We'll prominently display "Powered by Statiq" branding

What we need:
- API documentation
- API key/authentication credentials
- Real-time availability endpoints (if available)
- Pricing data per station

Our platform currently features 600+ stations and we're seeing strong engagement 
from EV owners actively looking for reliable charging options.

We believe this partnership would significantly benefit both our users and 
Statiq's business growth.

Could we schedule a brief 15-minute call to discuss this opportunity?

I'm available:
- Monday-Friday, 10 AM - 6 PM IST
- Or any time that works for your team

Looking forward to collaborating!

### Email 2: Ather Energy (Tech-Forward Company)

**To:** support@atherenergy.com  
**CC:** hello@atherenergy.com  
**Subject:** Tech Partnership - Ather Grid API Integration

```
Hi Ather Team,

As fellow tech builders working on India's EV future, I'd love to collaborate!

I'm developing EVCharge India (evcharge.in), a comprehensive EV charging 
discovery platform. Through my research, I found that Ather Grid uses 
api.atherenergy.com for your mobile app's data - impressive infrastructure!

Why this partnership makes sense:
✓ Many Ather vehicle owners use our platform
✓ We can showcase Ather Grid's unique features (covered parking, amenities)
✓ Cross-promotion: your stations reach more EV drivers
✓ Tech integration: real-time data = better user experience
✓ We'll link directly to Ather app for reservations

Technical Integration:
As developers, we can work with:
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- Webhooks
- Whatever works best for your architecture

What we're requesting:
1. API access to Ather Grid station locations
2. Real-time availability status
3. Station features and amenities data
4. Pricing information

Current status:
- 600+ stations on our platform
- Growing user base of EV owners
- Clean, modern tech stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL)

This is a win-win: better service for the EV community, more visibility for 
Ather Grid.

Can we chat about integrating our platforms?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

platform serving Indian EV drivers.
