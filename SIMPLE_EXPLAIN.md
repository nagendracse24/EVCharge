# ⚡ EVCharge India - Simple Explanation

## What I Built (100 words)

I built a **complete web app to find EV charging stations across India** - like Google Maps but specifically for electric vehicle chargers. 

Users can **search 600+ real stations** on an interactive map, see prices, amenities, and ratings, then **book charging slots in advance**. The app automatically updates station data daily from multiple sources (OpenChargeMap, OpenStreetMap).

Built with **React for the frontend**, **Node.js for the backend**, and **PostgreSQL database** - all hosted on cloud platforms (Vercel + Railway). Features include smart search, charging cost calculator, route planning, user accounts, favorites, and community reviews.
